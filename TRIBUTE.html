  <h1>Tribute to Sofia Vergara</h1>
  <p>Sofia Vergara (born July 10, 1972, Barranquilla, Colombia)is a Colombian-American actress, television producer, presenter, and model. Born on July 10, 1972, in Barranquilla, Colombia, Vergara first gained recognition for her role as Gloria Delgado-Pritchett on the ABC comedy series <em>Modern Family</em>.</p>
  <p>Vergara’s chance encounter with a photographer on a Colombian beach when she was 17 years old led her to abandon her plans for a career in dentistry to pursue modeling. In addition, she hosted Colombian TV shows until 1998, when her brother was murdered and her family relocated to Miami. There she hosted the Spanish-language game show A que no te atreves (“I Dare You”) and began landing small roles in American films and TV shows. She was one of the four principals of the romantic comedy Chasing Papi (2003), but the acting jobs she subsequently secured were smaller roles that primarily capitalized on her looks.</p>
  <p>Before her successful acting career, Sofia Vergara was known as a model, appearing in numerous commercials and as a host on Univision's <em>Fuera de serie</em> in the late 1990s. She later ventured into acting and quickly rose to fame for her comedic timing and irresistible charm.</p>
  <p>Vergara had supporting parts in the crime drama Four Brothers (2005) and the comedy Meet the Browns (2008) before she appeared in the role of Mama Morton in the Broadway revival of Chicago in 2009. That same year Vergara’s big break occurred when she joined the cast of Modern Family as Gloria Delgado-Pritchett, the much-younger wife of a man with two children near her own age—a daughter with a typical nuclear family of her own and a gay son with a male partner and an adopted daughter. Gloria had a young son from a previous marriage as well. The escapades of the nontraditional family struck a chord with viewers, and the series was an immediate popular and critical hit. Vergara was nominated for an Emmy Award four times for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy (2010–13). After 11 seasons, Modern Family ended in 2020.</p>
  <p>Throughout her career, Vergara has received several awards and nominations for her performances, including four Golden Globe nominations and seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations for <em>Modern Family</em>. In addition to her acting talents, she is also a successful businesswoman, with her own line of clothing and fragrance.</p>
  <p>Vergara was the breakout star of the show, and more film offers followed, with her appearing in such movies as Machete Kills (2013), Hot Pursuit (2015), and Bottom of the 9th (2019); the latter starred her husband, Joe Manganiello (married 2015). In addition, Vergara lent her voice to the animated comedy The Emoji Movie (2017). In 2020 she joined the reality-competition show America’s Got Talent as a judge. Moreover, she became a prevalent subject of celebrity blogs and tabloids as the rare female sex symbol to burst onto the international stage in her late 30s. Vergara also proved that she was a savvy businesswoman as she capitalized on her omnipresent celebrity status to grow Latin World Entertainment—a talent-management firm that she cofounded in 1994—into one of the most-powerful Hispanic media marketing companies in the world.</p>
  <p>In 2014 Vergara became a U.S. citizen. The following year she was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>

   <p>"I'm a natural blonde. But when I started acting, I would go to auditions and they didn't know where to put me because I was voluptuous and had the accent--but I had blonde hair. It was ignorance: they thought every Latin person looks like Salma Hayek."</p>
